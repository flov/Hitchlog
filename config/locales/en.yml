          It's about time to make the world a more hitchhiker friendly place.
          Log your personal hitchhiking experiences and we can paint
          an authentic picture about what hitchhiking is like.
          Together with your data we want to create statistics
          about hitchhiking. In the end we can tell the average waiting time in
          different countries, or we can compare positive against negative
          experiences and tell something about the security situation of hitchhiking.<br />
          Moreover your data will create your own personal hitchhiking profile. Giving you
          information about: <br/>
          Your hitchhiked kms, your positive/negative experiences, your average waiting times,
          your longest/fastest ride, the countries where you hitchhiked, and more. <br />
          If you have ever hitchhiked, you are welcome to
          <a href="/trips/new">share your experience with us</a>.
          With the information that you enter here you will be part of the project.

          A trip is a hitchhiking trip from <b>one city to another city</b> which is
          most of the time just one day.  For longer trips you can continue a trip
          later. That way you will be able to see the waypoints on the map.
