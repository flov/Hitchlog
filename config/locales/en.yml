          We are making the world a more hitchhiker friendly place.<br>
          By logging personal hitchhiking experiences, we are trying to paint
          an authentic picture about what hitchhiking is like.
          If you have ever hitchhiked, you are welcome to
          <a href="/trips/new">share your experience with us</a>.
          With the information that you enter here you will be part of the project.
          It will create statistical data and then we can tell the amount of positive/negative
          experiences, average waiting times, your longest/fastest ride, the
          countries where you hitchhiked, and more.

          The piechart below consists of the hitchhiked countries that have
          been logged by hitchhikers in the Hitchlog.

          A trip is a hitchhiking trip from <b>one city to another city</b> which is
          most of the time just one day.  For longer trips you can continue a trip
          later. That way you will be able to see the waypoints on the map.
