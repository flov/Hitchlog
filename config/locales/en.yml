          It's about time to make the world a more hitchhiker friendly place.
          <a href='/trips/new'>Log your hitchhiking experiences</a>
          and the Hitchlog paints a picture about what hitchhiking is actually
          like.
          Together with this data the Hitchlog creates statistics.
          It tells the average waiting time in different countries, it
          compares positive against negative experiences...
      text2: |
          Your data will create your own personal hitchhiking profile. Giving you
          information about: <br/>
          Your hitchhiked kms, your positive/negative experiences, your average waiting times,
          your longest/fastest ride, the countries where you hitchhiked, and more. <br />
          If you have ever hitchhiked, you are welcome to
          <a href="/trips/new">share your experience with us</a>.
          With the information that you enter here you will be part of the project.

          A trip is a hitchhiking trip from <b>one city to another city</b> which is
          most of the time just one day.  For longer trips you can continue a trip
          later. That way you will be able to see the waypoints on the map.
