          hitchhiker friendly place.

          <a href='/trips/new'>Log your hitchhiking experiences</a>

          A trip is a hitchhiking trip from <b>one city to another city</b> which is
          most of the time just one day.  For longer trips you can continue a trip
          later. That way you will be able to see the waypoints on the map.
